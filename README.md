# ISF-Equirectangular
quick, dirty and probably incomplete port to ISF of https://github.com/DanielArnett/360-VJ

Frankly I've forgotten why I started doing this as I don't own a VR headset.

From memory it works but the ISF inputs for pitch/yaw etc probably need checked.


PRs with fixes welcomed.
